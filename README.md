# Neuro-Evolution of Echo State Networks & Computation at the Edge of Chaos

### Neuro-Evolution of Echo State Networks & Computation at the Edge of Chaos

In this study, we compute the computational capacity of echo state networks over their dynamic range from order to chaos. 

Using neuroevolution to evolve echo state networks towards the edge of chaos.
